- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anoopdawar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a product advisor to Deepgram. I work closely with the CEO and VP Product.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focused on acivating a handbook and instilling iteration into the work we do at Deepgram.
- ðŸ“« If you want to meet me, please writeup an agenda doc and send it my way first. We can go back and forth on it till we think we actually need a sync meeting. I prefer to use vimcal as it keeps my personal and professional calendars in sync. https://book.vimcal.com/p/anoop/25m-dgad
